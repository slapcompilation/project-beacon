# Manage IPv4 usage

## What you are charged for

You can assign a dedicated [IPv4 address](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) to a database by enabling the [IPv4 add-on](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=ipv4). You are charged for all IPv4 addresses configured across your databases.

Note: IPv4 Hours are **not** covered by the [Spend Cap](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/cost-control#spend-cap).

Note: If the primary database has a dedicated IPv4 address configured, its Read Replicas are also assigned one, with charges for each.

## How charges are calculated

IPv4 addresses are charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that an IPv4 address is assigned to a database. If an address is assigned for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you enable the IPv4 add-on for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window                                 | IPv4 add-on | Hours Billed | Description         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM   | Disabled    | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM  | Disabled    | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM  | Enabled     | 1            | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Enabled     | 511          |                     |
