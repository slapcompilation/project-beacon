# Data REST API

Auto-generating data REST API.

Supabase auto-generates an API directly from your database schema allowing you to connect to your database through a restful interface, directly from the browser.

The API is auto-generated from your database and is designed to get you building as fast as possible, without writing a single line of code.

You can use them directly from the browser (two-tier architecture), or as a complement to your own API server (three-tier architecture).

Note: - You can find the API URL in the [**Integrations > Data API**](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/integrations/data_api/overview) section of the Dashboard.
- You can find the API Keys in the [**Settings > API Keys**](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/) section of the Dashboard.

## Features \[#rest-api-overview]

Supabase provides a RESTful API using [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/), a thin API layer on top of Postgres.
It exposes everything you need from a CRUD API at the URL `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/`.

The REST interface is automatically reflected from your database's schema and is:

- **Instant and auto-generated:** As you update your database the changes are immediately accessible through your API.
- **Self documenting:** Supabase generates documentation in the Dashboard which updates as you make database changes.
- **Secure:** The API is configured to work with Postgres's Row Level Security, provisioned behind an API gateway with key-auth enabled.
- **Fast:** Our benchmarks for basic reads are more than 300% faster than Firebase. The API is a very thin layer on top of Postgres, which does most of the heavy lifting.
- **Scalable:** The API can serve thousands of simultaneous requests, and works well for Serverless workloads.

The reflected API is designed to retain as much of Postgres' capability as possible including:

- Basic CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- Arbitrarily deep relationships among tables/views, functions that return table types can also nest related tables/views.
- Works with Postgres Views, Materialized Views and Foreign Tables
- Works with Postgres Functions
- User defined computed columns and computed relationships
- The Postgres security model - including Row Level Security, Roles, and Grants.

The REST API resolves all requests to a single SQL statement leading to fast response times and high throughput.
