# Security and governance

Palantir helps organizations solve real-world problems using powerful, secure software platforms. For more than a decade, we have worked with customers in the most secure and highly-regulated industries to build software for their most sensitive data. Today, security and privacy remain the cornerstone of our product development, company culture, and internal operations.

The Palantir platform is used by healthcare providers, financial institutions, utility providers, manufacturers, telecoms, airlines, and pharmaceutical companies around the globe to handle their most sensitive workflows. The Palantir platform was built for security-conscious customers who need the capability to handle financial data, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), and even classified government data in a secure and compliant manner. Palantir's security infrastructure meets regulatory requirements across industries and continents by aligning with frameworks like HIPAA, GDPR, and ITAR.

As our software powers mission-critical operations across major corporations and governments alike, our threat model focuses on defeating attacks by highly resourced, technical, and persistent adversaries. To defeat these adversaries, we take a highly opinionated stance and enforce a high minimum bar of security for all our customers. For example, multi-factor authentication has been mandatory for all our managed Software as a Service (SaaS) platform customers for years.

## Platform security

The Palantir platform has security as a core development philosophy. The Palantir security model enables strict enforcement of granular access controls with transparency and usability to build a collaborative and trusted ecosystem:

* **Strict enforcement:** Ensures users only have access to data that they have been authorized to interact with.
* **Granular controls:** Powerful enough to achieve flexible levels of access control granularity.
* **Transparency:** Enables users to reason about *who* has access to *what* resource and *why*.
* **Usability:** Empowers users to reason about and manage access controls with confidence.

The Palantir security model encompasses both authentication and authorization. Authentication verifies the identity of a user, while authorization grants access based on a user’s attributes and permissions.

Data security in the Palantir platform is guaranteed through a combination of mandatory and discretionary controls. Mandatory controls propagate along with each unit of data or resource type, via Palantir's sophisticated provenance and lineage capabilities. Discretionary permissions are granted to users on individual resources, in the form of roles with different operations (for example, view or edit). In addition, granular row or column-level controls based on a user’s attributes can be put in place on resources too.

Data and resources in the Palantir platform are organized in Projects. Users belong to Organizations, and are organized in groups managed within the platform or through external identity providers. Organizations are one form of mandatory controls applied to Projects that enforce strict silos between groups of users and resources. Therefore, users of one Organization cannot access the resources of another Organization unless sharing protocols have explicitly been configured.

For highly sensitive data, markings are another form of mandatory controls that can be applied to data or resources that require special protection (for example, PII or financially sensitive data). Users must have special permission to discover or access such data, in addition to Organization membership.

## Enterprise security

We reject the notion of gating, pay-walling, or upselling core security controls like audit logging, single sign-on, and multi-factor authentication. Whether you are a small business or a federal agency, you get access to every core enterprise security feature in the standard Palantir offering:

* Mandatory **encryption** of all data, both in transit and at rest, that uses robust, modern cryptography standards.
* Strong **authentication** and identity protection controls, including single sign-on and multi-factor authentication.
* Strong **authorization** controls, including mandatory and discretionary access controls.
* Robust **security audit logging** for detecting and investigating potential abuse.
* Highly extensible **information governance, management, and privacy controls** to meet the needs of any use case.

## Infrastructure security

If you are using our managed SaaS platform, Palantir’s hosted infrastructure has additional layers of security controls to help protect your data:

* Robust **security architecture** built around principles of zero trust, least privilege, and defense-in-depth.
* Enforced **security baseline configurations** with rigorous change management and security monitoring processes.
* Strong **network security** hardening and segmentation.
* Host-based and network-based **intrusion detection systems** to detect and defeat anomalous activity.
* Aggressive **infrastructure and application vulnerability management and patching**, with industry-leading SLAs.
* **Web application firewall** (WAF) inspection of incoming web requests to detect and block attacks.
* **Security monitoring** at every layer of the environment, including users, hosts, networks, and applications.

## Additional security resources

Palantir has a [SafeBase Trust Center page ↗](https://palantir.safebase.us/) to house all security documentation and information. You can use SafeBase to help answer questions related to our security standards and procedures. SafeBase includes security whitepapers, policies, pen test reports, compliance information, certifications (such as SOC and ISO), and more.

Existing and prospective customers under NDA can request access to additional non-public materials.

## Conclusion

Palantir cares deeply about the security outcomes of our customers, and we are committed to transparency about our security practices and program. We stand resolute in continuously improving our security, data protection, and privacy controls to give you the most effective means of protecting your data possible.
