# Transforms

Foundry `Transforms` are the core building blocks of data processing pipelines. They define how data flows from inputs to outputs, encapsulating both the computational logic and resource requirements in a single, declarative unit.

Transforms are registered in `Pipelines` that can be made up of multiple transform definitions.

## Define transforms

Every transform consists of three key components:

1. **Decorators:** Define inputs, outputs, and configuration
2. **Function signature:** Matches the inputs and outputs declared in the decorator
3. **Compute logic:** The actual data processing code

Below is the basic pattern used to define transforms:

```python
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using( # decorator
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'), # inputs
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed') # outputs
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color, processed):  # function signature matches input/output
    ... # compute logic
```

Python transforms can be configured with either single-node (lightweight) or multi-node (Spark) [compute engines](/docs/foundry/transforms-python/compute-engines/). By default, transforms run on a single-node, and you can load the data as a [Polars ↗](https://docs.pola.rs/) or [pandas ↗](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame. Polars is a DataFrame library for transforming tabular data. It is known for its performance, stability, and ease of use. Pandas is a widely adopted and easy to use data analysis tool.

To retrieve a DataFrame, call the appropriate method on your input as shown below:

```python tab="Polars"
import polars as pl
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using(
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'),
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed')
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color, processed):
    # Load data as Polars DataFrame
    df = hair_eye_color.polars()

    # Apply filtering logic
    filtered = df.filter(pl.col('hair') == 'Brown')

    # Write the result
    processed.write_table(filtered)
```

```python tab="DuckDB"
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using(
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'),
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed')
)
def filter_hair_color(ctx, hair_eye_color, processed):
    # Get DuckDB connection
    conn = ctx.duckdb().conn

    # Apply filtering logic using SQL
    filtered = conn.sql("SELECT * FROM hair_eye_color WHERE hair = 'Brown'")

    # Write the result
    processed.write_table(filtered)
```

```python tab="Pandas"
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using(
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'),
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed')
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color, processed):
    # Load data as Pandas DataFrame
    df = hair_eye_color.pandas()

    # Apply filtering logic
    filtered = df[df['hair'] == 'Brown']

    # Write the result
    processed.write_table(filtered)
```

The example below demonstrates that transforms can take multiple inputs and outputs.

```python
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using(
    hair_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_color'),
    eye_color=Input('/examples/students_eye_color'),
    males=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_males'),
    females=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_females'),
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_color, eye_color, males, females):
    ...
```

## Work with varied data formats

The lightweight transforms API supports loading data in a variety of formats, as demonstrated in the example below:

```python
@transform.using(output=Output('/Project/folder/output'), dataset=Input('/Project/folder/input'))
def compute(ctx, output, dataset):
    polars_df = dataset.polars()         # polars_df is a polars.DataFrame object
    lazy_df = dataset.polars(lazy=True)  # Activate streaming mode, lazy_df is a polars.LazyFrame
    pandas_df = dataset.pandas()         # pandas_df is a pandas.DataFrame
    arrow_table = dataset.arrow()        # arrow_table is a pyarrow.Table

    # DuckDB connection with pre-registered input datasets
    conn = ctx.duckdb().conn
    df_from_duckdb = conn.sql("SELECT * FROM dataset").fetchdf()  # dataset is automatically registered

    output.write_table(lazy_df)          # Any of the formats above can be passed to write_table
```

Note that calling `dataset.pandas()` expects pandas to be installed in your environment. Likewise, `dataset.polars(...)` requires Polars to be available.

## Configure compute resources

You can control the compute resources allocated to your transforms using the `.with_resources()` method.

```python
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.using(
    large_dataset=Input('/datasets/large_file'),
    processed=Output('/datasets/processed')
).with_resources(
    cpu_cores=8,          # Use 8 CPU cores
    memory_gb=16,         # Allocate 16GB memory
)
def process_large_dataset(large_dataset, processed):
    ...
```

* **`cpu_cores`:** The number of CPU cores. This can be fractional, for example, `0.5`, defaults to `2`.
* **`memory_mb`** or **`memory_gb`:** Memory allocation; only use one, not both.

## Transform context

There may be cases when a data transformation depends on things other than its input datasets. For instance, a transformation may be required to access the current Spark session or to contact an external service. In such cases, you can inject a `TransformContext` object into the transformation.

To inject a `TransformContext` object, your compute function must accept a parameter called `ctx`. Note that this also means that no inputs or outputs may be named `ctx`. Refer to the [API reference ↗](/docs/foundry/api-reference/transforms-python-library/api-overview/) for the full set of `TransformContext` capabilities.

```python
from transforms.api import transform, Output


@transform.using(
    out=Output('/examples/context')
)
def generate_dataframe(ctx, out):
    ...
```

## Pyspark transforms

By default, transforms run on a single compute node and leverage data processing libraries like pandas or Polars. For big data compute workflows, [PySpark ↗](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html) can be leveraged in Python transforms.

PySpark is a wrapper language that allows you to interface with an Apache Spark backend to quickly process data. Spark can operate on very large datasets across a distributed network of servers, which provides scaling and reliability benefits when used correctly. However, it also comes with higher overhead and resource usage, making it a poor choice for small to medium scale data.

While a high-level overview of the PySpark transforms APIs are given here, refer to the [Python transforms (Spark)](/docs/foundry/transforms-python-spark/overview/) documentation for more details.

### Define PySpark transforms

PySpark transforms are defined with similar syntax to standard transforms.

```python tab="PySpark"
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.spark.using(
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'),
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed')
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color, processed):
    ... # transform logic goes here
```

Similarly to Polars or pandas transforms, a DataFrame object can be retrieved from the transform input.

```python tab="PySpark"
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.spark.using(
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color'),
    processed=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed')
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color, processed):
    filtered_df = hair_eye_color.dataframe().filter(hair_eye_color.dataframe().hair == 'Brown')
    processed.write_dataframe(filtered_df)
```

:::callout{theme="neutral"}
The [`DataFrame` ↗](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.html) objects returned by transform inputs are PySpark DataFrames. For more information about working with PySpark, refer to the [Spark Python API documentation ↗](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html).
:::

PySpark transforms can also take multiple inputs and outputs:

```python tab="PySpark"
from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output


@transform.spark.using(
    hair_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_color'),
    eye_color=Input('/examples/students_eye_color'),
    males=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_males'),
    females=Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_females'),
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_color, eye_color, males, females):
    ...
```

Since PySpark transforms only support one data processing library, the `transform_df` decorator can be used to directly access the [`DataFrame` ↗](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.html) for convenience.

```python tab="PySpark"
from transforms.api import transform_df, Input, Output


@transform_df(
    Output('/examples/hair_eye_color_processed'),
    hair_eye_color=Input('/examples/students_hair_eye_color')
)
def filter_hair_color(hair_eye_color):
    return hair_eye_color.filter(hair_eye_color.hair == 'Brown')
```

### Configure PySpark transforms

In PySpark transforms, resources are configured with [spark profiles](/docs/foundry/optimizing-pipelines/apply-spark-profiles/). These allow strict access controls for large scale compute usage.

### Transform logic level versioning

:::callout{theme="warning" title="Warning"}
For TLLV to function correctly, your code must declare all imports at the module level and should not attempt to patch or otherwise modify objects in another module. If this is not the case in your project, **you must disable TLLV**. Refer to the code example below for more information. <br><br>
**TLLV is enabled by default.** To disable TLLV set tllv in transformsPython configuration to **false**. This configuration is inside the `build.gradle` file in your Python transforms subproject. <br><br>

```
transformsPython {
    tllv false
}
```
:::

A transform’s version is a string that is used to compare two versions of a transform when considering logic staleness. A transform’s output is up to date if its inputs are unchanged and if the transform’s version is unchanged. If the version changes, the transform’s output will be invalidated and recomputed.

By default, a transform’s version includes the following:

* The module where the transform is defined
* All modules that the transform depends on
* Any project dependencies

If any of these change, the version string will be changed.
If you want to invalidate outputs if a change happens in file that is not covered by listed parts, set `tllvFiles` in the `transformsPython` configuration. An example use case is if you are reading a file's configuration and want to invalidate outputs when the configuration is changed.

### Transactionality

Transforms execute in the context of a transaction that is opened on the outputs and committed upon success of the job. If no logic is defined on outputs or errors during write are caught and swallowed, a successful transform will result in an empty snapshot on such outputs.
