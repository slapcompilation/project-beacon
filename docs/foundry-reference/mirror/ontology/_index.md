# Ontology building

The Palantir **Ontology** is an operational layer for the organization. The Ontology sits on top of the digital assets integrated into the Palantir platform ([datasets](/docs/foundry/data-integration/datasets/), [virtual tables](/docs/foundry/data-integration/virtual-tables/), and [models](/docs/foundry/integrate-models/integrate-overview/)) and connects them to their real-world counterparts, ranging from physical assets like plants, equipment, and products to concepts like customer orders or financial transactions. In many settings, the Ontology serves as a digital twin of the organization, containing both the semantic elements (objects, properties, links) and kinetic elements (actions, functions, dynamic security) needed to enable use cases of all types.

## Object and link types

Defining the semantics of your organization happens by mapping existing datasources into **objects, properties, and links** in the Ontology. Far beyond data cataloging or schema design solutions, the Ontology allows you to define a robust foundation for end-user workflows, including rich metadata for all fields and complete with granular security and governance for all changes.

Learn about creating the semantic elements of the Ontology: [object types](/docs/foundry/object-link-types/object-types-overview/) and [link types](/docs/foundry/object-link-types/link-types-overview/).

## Action types and functions

The kinetics of the organization—enabling change while complying with organizational controls and governance—are defined in the Ontology using **action types** and **functions**. Action types enable you to capture data from operators in your organization or orchestrate decision-making processes that connect to your existing systems, while functions provide a way to author and evolve business logic with arbitrary complexity.

Learn about creating the kinetic elements of the Ontology: [action types](/docs/foundry/action-types/overview/) and [functions](/docs/foundry/functions/overview/).

## Interfaces

An **interface** is an Ontology type that describes the shape of an object type and its capabilities. Interfaces provide object type polymorphism, allowing for consistent modeling of and interaction with object types that share a common shape.

Learn more about [interfaces](/docs/foundry/interfaces/interface-overview/).

## Powering decision-making

The goal of investing in the Ontology is to facilitate better decision-making in an organization at scale. To achieve this, the Ontology is deeply integrated into Palantir's user-facing analytical and operational tools: users can create reusable Object Views, search for objects of interest in Object Explorer, perform complex analyses in Quiver, build high-quality applications in Workshop, and more.
