# List Versions

`GET /api/v2/thirdPartyApplications/{thirdPartyApplicationRid}/website/versions`

Lists all Versions.

This is a paged endpoint. Each page may be smaller or larger than the requested page size. However, it is guaranteed that if there are more results available, the `nextPageToken` field will be populated. To get the next page, make the same request again, but set the value of the `pageToken` query parameter to be value of the `nextPageToken` value of the previous response. If there is no `nextPageToken` field in the response, you are on the last page.

Third-party applications using this endpoint via OAuth2 must request the following operation scope: `third-party-application:deploy-application-website`.

Scopes: `third-party-application:deploy-application-website`
